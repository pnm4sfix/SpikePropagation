Description: This is a collection of metadata files corresponding to the figures in the PLOS Biology article "Dorsal root ganglia control nociceptive input to the central nervous system" by
Hao H, Ramli R, Wang C, Liu C, Shah S, Mullen P, Lall V, Jones F, Shao J, Zhang H, Jaffe DB, Gamper N, Du X (2022). Data are presented in Excel files, each file correspond to a single figure (e.g. file "Metadata-Fig1.xlsx" contains all metadata used to plot graphs in the Figure 1; file "Metadata-Suppl-Fig1.xlsx" contains data for Supplemental Figure 1 etc. If a figure contains multiple graphs, the corresponding file will have multiple spreadsheets, named according to the panel it corresponds to (e.g. sheet "1E" in the file "Metadata-Fig1.xlsx" corresponds to the panel E in the Figure 1).

Code and instructions for the Spike sorting and analysis are provided in GitHub repository DOI:10.5281/zenodo.7350612

Fig.2A-E. These were created using the matplotlib and seaborn libraries and can be reproduced by running the scripts or Jupyter notebook “Analysis (060720).ipynb” in the GitHub repository DOI:10.5281/zenodo.7350612. Panels 2A and 2C are from raw data and spiketrains that are saved in Neuroscience Information Exchange (NIX) format as “Fig2.blk” in folder NIX_data (DOI:10.5281/zenodo.7350612). These can be accessed using python and by following the jupyter notebook in the repository (DOI:10.5281/zenodo.7350612). Panel 2C was created by using the command  spike_analysis() in sa_core.py on Github. Panles B, D, E were created in python from data stored in “Fig2.blk”  with scripts in the Github repository.

Fig.S5 A-B. Panel A was produced by running the spike_analysis() function in sa_core.py during the spike matching process. Panel B was produced by running the simulation notebook (1.5cm inter electrode sim.ipynb) in the github repository.

Fig. S6 A-D. Panel A was produced by the python function spike_analysis() in sa_core.py (in Github repository DOI:10.5281/zenodo.7350612) from FigS6.blk in NIX_data. Panels B-D were created in python from data stored in “FigS6.blk” with scripts in the Github repository (DOI:10.5281/zenodo.7350612). Data containing the waveforms in Fig. S6B, C, D  was also saved in excel sheets now in FigS6BCD.xlsx.

Fig. S7. Panel A was produced in Jupyter notebook “Analysis (060720).ipynb by extracting the waveforms from the NIX file from each recording. Panel B was created in python using matplotlib from the metadata in FigS7B.xlsx. Panel C was created in python from the instantaneous firing rates calculated from the NIX recording file and saved in FigS7C.xlsx.

Code and instructions for the computer modeling of t-junctional filtering are provided in GitHub repository ???
